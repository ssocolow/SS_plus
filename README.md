# htpm
This is a project to develop a human trajectory prediction model/method.  Inspired by https://github.com/xuehaouwa/SS-LSTM
(shtp means standard human trajectory prediction)

## Quick Start
Here is a google collab file to explore: 
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HQgejgDW-bQ4lh8iklCOmB7Q8fzEEOVw?usp=sharing

Or you can run it locally by running these commands:  
  
Download the files  
`git clone https://github.com/ssocolow/htpm.git`  
  
Go into the directory  
`cd htpm`  
  
Make the setup script executable (you may not have to do this step, do if the next step returns a permissions error)
`chmod +x setup.sh`  
  
Run the setup script  
`./setup.sh`  
  
Train the model  
`python3 ADI_model.py`
